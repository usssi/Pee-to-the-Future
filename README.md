## About the Game

**Pee to the Future** is a quirky first-person game where players control the urine stream of a (presumably) drunk protagonist to complete a series of absurd and hilarious challenges. Forget saving the world – your mission involves filling up a toilet bowl, spraying cockroaches off urinals, and tackling other unconventional tasks with gusto.

Originally created for the **VGC Jam 2023** in just one week, the game was released on Itch.io on November 20th, 2023.

### Gameplay Features

-   **Unique Core Mechanic:** Control the direction and force of a urine stream with precision.
-   **Simple Controls:** Utilizes straightforward one-input gameplay, focusing on player skill in aiming and timing.
-   **Absurd Challenges:** Engage in unconventional tasks across uniquely designed levels.
-   **Physics-Based Interactions:** Master the stream's arc and impact to interact with the environment effectively.
-   **Themed Levels:** Progress through distinct environments including a medieval castle bathroom, a night bar restroom, and a construction site porta-potty.

## My Role and Impact (Project Lead)

As the **Project Lead**, I coordinated a diverse team of nine individuals, navigating varying experience levels to ensure smooth collaboration and efficient development under the tight constraints of the game jam (7 days). My focus was on establishing a clear vision and facilitating communication.

Beyond leadership, I was heavily involved in the technical and creative aspects:

### Key Contributions:

-   **Game Systems & Level Design:** Developed the core aiming and stream mechanics (C#), designed player interactions, and crafted the distinct layouts and objectives for each level within the Unity engine.
-   **Technical Implementation:** Handled primary gameplay programming, implemented scene lighting setups, developed UI elements and interactions (using Unity's UI system), and created custom visual effects including shaders for the "drunk" effect (ShaderLab, HLSL).
-   **Artistic & Audio Direction:** Contributed to the game's audiovisual identity through 3D modeling, texture work, and implementing the sound design and dynamic music system.
-   **Production & Team Coordination:** Managed the project scope, organized tasks (e.g., using Trello/HackNPlan), and maintained development workflow efficiency throughout the jam.

## Development Story: Rapid Prototyping

The core concept underwent rapid iteration over a single weekend prior to the main jam week. These prototypes quickly established and refined the fundamental gameplay loop and visual feedback mechanisms.

### Prototypes (Developed over one weekend):

1.  **Prototype 1: Core Mechanics & Feedback**
    * Established the foundational aiming system.
    * Implemented key visual feedback using Unity's particle system for the stream.
    * Included initial gameplay elements like "ammo" count and scoring (later iterated upon).
    * `Focus:` Validate core interaction and aiming feel.

2.  **Prototype 2: Diegetic UI & Immersion**
    * Removed most traditional UI elements.
    * Shifted progress indicators to be fully diegetic within the game world (e.g., fill levels).
    * Added a prototype for player arms/body presence to enhance first-person immersion.
    * `Focus:` Enhance player immersion and intuitive feedback.

3.  **Prototype 3: Visual Polish & Gameplay Expansion**
    * Introduced a significant visual update using custom shaders to create the distinct "drunk vision" effect.
    * Added a new gameplay mode/variation (details may vary based on final game).
    * Implemented first iterations of environmental level design concepts.
    * `Focus:` Define visual style and expand gameplay scope.
